# Task Automation

This is a task automation project.

The code will control the keyboard and mouse to open an incognito window in Google Chrome, login to Gmail, and write an email with data from a database in a CSV file, send the email and close the opened windows.

The Gmail login information, email recipient, and message are inputted into an file named infos.txt, and the code processes them.

<h5 align="center">NOTE: It is common knowledge that there are simpler ways to send emails with Python. However, the goal of this project was to understand task automation, and apply these concepts to various other activities.</h5>
