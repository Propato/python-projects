# Artificial Intelligence

The program will read a csv file with information and prices of a set of boats, and the code will develop and train two AIs to determine the price of other boats (given their information). During the code execution, the AIs were compared during testing to determine the most accurate one in this scenario, and it was chosen to determine the prices of the new boats.
